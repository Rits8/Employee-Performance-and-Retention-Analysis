Project A: Employee Performance and Retention Analysis

Executive Summary
This project analyzes employee-level data to identify factors contributing to attrition risk and generate actionable insights for HR. Using risk scoring and cohort-level analysis, we highlight high-risk groups, underlying drivers, and potential interventions.
Key Findings:
Departments 6 and 2 show the highest average risk scores, indicating elevated attrition potential.

Employees with lower training scores consistently have higher risk scores.

New hires (tenure < 2 years) are disproportionately represented in high-risk cohorts.

Engagement-related metrics (training, performance scores) strongly correlate with retention likelihood.

Cohort-Level Insights
By Department:

Department 6 (avg. risk ≈ 2.98) and Department 2 (avg. risk ≈ 2.98) are the most vulnerable.

These cohorts require targeted retention strategies.

By Tenure:

Risk is higher among employees with short tenure (<2 years), suggesting onboarding and early engagement gaps.

By Training Scores:

Employees with training scores below the median fall into higher-risk categories.

Upskilling programs could reduce attrition risk.

Actionable Recommendations
Department Focus:

Prioritize Departments 6 and 2 for engagement and retention initiatives.

Implement leadership check-ins, team culture surveys, and targeted incentives.

Onboarding & Early Tenure Support:

Strengthen mentorship and buddy programs for employees within their first 2 years.

Structured career progression plans to reduce early exits.

Training & Development:

Expand learning & development for employees with low training scores.

Track impact of training on risk reduction over time.

Recognition & Rewards:

Introduce reward mechanisms for consistent performance to improve morale.

Tailor recognition programs by department to boost engagement.

Business Impact
If HR reduces attrition risk in the top two high-risk departments by 5%, the organization could save significant costs in:
Recruitment & hiring

Onboarding & training replacements

Productivity losses due to churn

Final Conclusion:
The analysis identifies specific high-risk cohorts (Departments 6 & 2, new hires, low training performers) and provides clear HR actions to mitigate attrition risk.
 Adopting these strategies will improve employee engagement, retention, and overall organizational stability.
